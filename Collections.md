# Collections

### Why collection is required ?
There are several reasons we require collections. So here it is.

 * When input size is dynamic.
 * Collection framework is nothing but the data structure in Java. So we can use itâ€™s functionality instead of writing too much
 code.
 * Whenever you are required to store heterogeneous data.
 * When data grows and shrinks frequently.
 * Arrays are not resizable.
 * Java Collections Framework provides lots of different useful data types, such as linked lists (allows insertion anywhere in
 constant time), resizeable array lists (like Vector but cooler), red-black trees, hash-based maps (like Hashtable but cooler).
 * Java Collections Framework provides abstractions, so you can refer to a list as a List, whether backed by an array list or
 a linked list; and you can refer to a map/dictionary as a Map, whether backed by a red-black tree or a hashtable
